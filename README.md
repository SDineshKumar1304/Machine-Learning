# Project List

## Project : 1 Car Auction Price Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict car auction prices using machine learning. It is organized into the following directories:

- **Dataset:** Contains dataset files used for training and evaluation.
- **Model:** Stores trained machine learning models and related files.
- **Scrapping_Code:** Includes code for web scraping (if applicable).
- **Training_Code:** Contains code for training machine learning models.

# Project : 2 Simple Linear Regression: Area and Price Prediction

## Overview

This project showcases a simple linear regression model to predict property prices based on their areas. The dataset includes two variables: "Area" (in square feet) and "Price" (in currency). The objective is to create an accurate linear regression model for predicting property prices.
