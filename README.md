## Introduction
This repository serves as a showcase for my journey in machine learning. I'm passionate about leveraging data to build intelligent systems, and these projects reflect my efforts in that direction. Feel free to explore, learn, and contribute!

# Project List

## Project : 1 Car Auction Price Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict car auction prices using machine learning. It is organized into the following directories:

- **Dataset:** Contains dataset files used for training and evaluation.
- **Model:** Stores trained machine learning models and related files.
- **Scrapping_Code:** Includes code for web scraping (if applicable).
- **Training_Code:** Contains code for training machine learning models.

# Project : 2 Simple Linear Regression: Area and Price Prediction

## Overview

This project showcases a simple linear regression model to predict property prices based on their areas. The dataset includes two variables: "Area" (in square feet) and "Price" (in currency). The objective is to create an accurate linear regression model for predicting property prices.

# The Telco customer churn data
This data contains information about a fictional telco company that provided home phone and Internet services to 7043 customers in California in Q3. It indicates which customers have left, stayed, or signed up for their service. Multiple important demographics are included for each customer, as well as a Satisfaction Score, Churn Score, and Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) index. https://community.ibm.com/community/user/businessanalytics/blogs/steven-macko/2019/07/11/telco-customer-churn-1113

Churn is when customers stop using a product or service. For example, if someone cancels their phone plan or stops using a streaming service, it's considered churn. Businesses pay close attention to churn because it's important to keep customers happy and prevent them from leaving, as gaining new customers can be more costly. Understanding why customers leave helps businesses improve and retain their customer base.
I've conducted an analysis of the provided customer dataset.
The dataset contains information about both male and female customers. A significant portion of the customers are not senior citizens. Relationship Status:

# Churn Analysis:
The "Churn" column is crucial as it indicates whether a customer has left the service. It's important to investigate factors that contribute to churn, such as tenure, service types, and additional features.
