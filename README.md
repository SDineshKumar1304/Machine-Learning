## Project : 1 Car Auction Price Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict car auction prices using machine learning. It is organized into the following directories:

- **Dataset:** Contains dataset files used for training and evaluation.
- **Model:** Stores trained machine learning models and related files.
- **Scrapping_Code:** Includes code for web scraping (if applicable).
- **Training_Code:** Contains code for training machine learning models.

## Directories

### 1. Dataset

This directory holds dataset files used for training and evaluating the machine learning model.

### 2. Model

Save your trained machine learning models and related files in this directory.

### 3. Scrapping_Code

If you have any code related to web scraping, it can be found in this directory.

### 4. Training_Code

This directory contains code for training machine learning models.
